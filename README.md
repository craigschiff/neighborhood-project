You should sign up as a user or a business.

A user can browse events including simple search and filtering by category. They can RSVP or register interest in events. If they change their mind they can delete the RSVP (or interest). The events are managed for the user in their calendar on their profile page. A user can also follow businesses and then see events from the businesses they follow. After attending an event the user must provide a review. 

A business can post and edit events. Their business page shows all events and the users that follow them. They also have user reviews on all completed events.
